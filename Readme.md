# Login and Password System | Portugol StudioðŸ’»

Â Â Â Â This code has been created, based on the classes of "Progamming Languages", "First steps in programming on Portugol" and "Algorithms", by teacher Juliana Mascaranhas on the plataform DIO.

## Algorithm

Â Â Â Â The algoritm has been created based on projects in the internet, by the author using codes with similar functions. i rewrote this code making sure, all the features gonna work with no problems and the code stay clear, like the original code but now, with no divergences on the final resultes.

## Instructions

Â Â Â Â Just acessing the program, it'll ask for the "**login**" and the "**password**", which are both pre-select by "_programming_", to make it easy to test. The login and password, can be changed, just changing the word "programming" to whatever the user want, in the sessions **se**, after the equal symbols (**=**).

## Conclusion

Â Â Â Â After realize all the tests, the program is working with no bugs and no divergences. Using a simple code on Portugol Studio.
